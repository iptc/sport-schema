# About the IPTC Sport Schema

IPTC Sport Schema was created by the IPTC Sports Content Working group, the team behind
[SportsML](https://iptc.org/standards/sportsml-g2/).

Version 1.0 of the schema was approved by the IPTC Standards Committee on 4 October 2023.

Version 1.0.1, an erratum update fixing some property definitions and ranges, was released
