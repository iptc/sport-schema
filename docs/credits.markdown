# About the IPTC Sport Schema

IPTC Sport Schema was created by the IPTC Sports Content Working group, the team behind
[SportsML](https://iptc.org/standards/sportsml-g2/).

Please note that the schema documented on this site is _**not a production ready version of the
Sport Schema**_. We have released our initial work in order to solicit feedback and suggestions
from others. _**Please do not rely on this model for your production work - yet!**_

development of the IPTC Sport Schema over the past few years:
