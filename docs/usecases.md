# IPTC Sport Schema Use Cases

To plan and track progress, and to make sure our model solves real-world problems, we are taking a use case-driven approach when
designing the IPTC Sport Schema.

The use cases are written as questions. Each use case/question should be answered with a SPARQL query based on our sample triples generated from converted SportsML files. 

Implementing all of these use cases, along with the corresponding sample data triples, is a work in progress, but most use cases are now implemented.

## All-Time Statistics and Results Questions

### Player (also known as Athlete)

1. Show linking from event action to description, article, photo and video.

## Corrections
1. How does the model cope, if the data supplier makes a mistake and sends through a correction several minutes after the original data was published? +
This happens frequently - either a goalscorer was named incorrectly in football or the wrong person was named as a substitute etc
1. Eg Harry Kane was named as the goalscorer in the 85th minute of a Spurs v West Ham EPL match +
After a VAR review in the 87th minute, a correction is sent through from Opta saying it has been designated an own goal.
1. As a Football Editor, I need the data model to cope with multiple corrections to data sent to us from external suppliers, 
during the course of a match and post match. + 
So I can ensure we are showing the correct information to users
1. Real world example - December 2020
PSG v Istanbul Basaksehir Champions league match was abandoned 14 mins into the match and then rescheduled for the next day: 
https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55242656
https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55219529
The incident happened just 14 minutes into the Group H tie, which was still goalless. The match recommenced from the 14th minute the following day's kick-off at 17:55 GMT. Opta reused the same match ID (g2170557) over both days with different kick off times, the status moved from mid-event through abandoned then pre-event when rescheduled. 

## Edge Cases
1. Disciplinary action before event started. Real world example - 2017-11-02 Vitória Guimarães v Marseille in Europa League. Evra, starting on the bench for Marseille, received red card ejection before the soccer match started.
1. Score recorded after the event concluded. Real world example - 2020-10-26 Brighton and Hove Albion v Manchester United, English Premier League. Bruno Fernandes scored a penalty that was awarded (by the video assistant referee) after the final whistle.
