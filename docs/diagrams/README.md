PlantUML diagrams used in documentation

These files are generated using [PlantUML ](http://www.plantuml.com/).

To generate them locally, you must have PlantUML installed, which
requires a Java installation (such as OpenJDK) and Graphviz to be
installed locally.

On a Mac, we suggest using Homebrew:

```
brew install plantuml
```

This will automatically install any dependencies required.

After PlantUML is installed, simply run it over the .uml files:

```
plantuml *.uml
```

It will automatically create .jpg files with the same name as the .uml files.
